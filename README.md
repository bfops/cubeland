cubeland
========

Infinite procedural landscape. Not a game yet.

Derived from [pong-rs](https://github.com/zokier/pong-rs).


Dependencies
============

* [glfw-rs](https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs)
* [gl-rs](https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs)
* [cgmath-rs](https://github.com/bjz/cgmath-rs)
* [noise-rs](https://github.com/bjz/noise-rs)
* Rust nightly (0.9-pre)


Building
========

`rustpkg build cubeland` should work in theory. Recent versions of glfw-rs are
not compatible with rustpkg.
